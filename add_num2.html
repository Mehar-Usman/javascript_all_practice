<!-- The sum variable is added in this code to
     keep track of the running total of the numbers
      as they are added together. During the iteration thr
      ough the nums array, each number is added to the sum variable using 
      the += operator, which is a shorthand way of writing sum = sum + parseInt(nums[i]). 
      At the end of the loop, the final value of sum represents the total sum of all the numbers
       in the nums array, which is then displayed to the user. Without the sum variable, there would be 
    no way to keep track of the running total and the addition operation would not work correctly. -->
