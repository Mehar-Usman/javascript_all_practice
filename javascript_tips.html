// explained increment and decreement=>

// The main difference between "++x" and "x++" in JavaScript is the order in which the increment operation 
// is applied to the variable.

//         The "++x" notation is called pre - increment, which means that the increment operation is applied 
// to the variable x before any other operation is performed.This means that the new 
// value of x is returned immediately after the increment operation is performed.

// On the other hand, the "x++" notation is called post - increment, which means that the increment operation
//  is applied to the variable x after all other operations in the expression have been performed.
// This means that the original value of x is returned first, and then the increment operation is performed.

// Here are some examples to illustrate the difference between pre - increment and post - increment:

let a = 5;
let b = ++x; // pre-increment
console.log(x); // Output: 6
console.log(y); // Output: 6

// In this example, the pre-increment operator "++x" is used to increment the value of x before assigning
//  it to the variable y. Therefore, both x and y have a value of 6 after the expression is evaluated.



let x = 5;
let y = x++; // post-increment
console.log(x); // Output: 6
console.log(y); // Output: 5

// In this example, the post-increment operator "x++" is used to assign the value of x to 
// the variable y before incrementing x. Therefore, x has a value of 6 after the expression is evaluated, 
// but y has the original value of x before the increment operation, which is 5.
